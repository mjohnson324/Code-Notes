# Technical Interviewing Techniques

* The interview is about communication first and foremost.
* Do not make assumptions about what the interviewer wants
* Prioritize describing your thought process over getting a solution.
* Ask the interviewer how detailed they want you to be in your solution.
* Start with a high-level idea.
* Leave room to write an outline and some extra details.
* Go one block at a time.
* Track your time.
* Do not worry about saying something wrong.
* Believe in yourself!

## Four Different Things to Focus on When Whiteboarding

1. **Requirements** - Think about the requirements, including inputs, outputs, test cases, and edge cases (**IOTE**). Review your assumptions with the interviewer before beginning.
2. **Logic** - Before you start coding, consider the logic behind the problem. If the problem is complex, you should break it down into smaller problems. Once you have broken things down, take note of the steps or pseudo-code the problem. *This shows the interviewer your problem solving process, and also, gives them a chance to sign off on your solution.* This technique will help prevent errors you may make while coding out the problem.
3. **Syntax** - *If you are confused or concerned about your syntax, circle it so that you can come back to it and redefine your logic if necessary.*
4. **Testing** - Test your solution. Use specific test cases if they gave them to you. If you get the wrong solution you must debug your code. Finally, talk through cases that would break your solution and possible solutions to the problems they pose with your interviewer.

## Types of Technical Questions (Most Theoretical to Most Practical)

1. Algorithms
2. Design (application structure and thought processes)
3. Pairing

## Steps to Solving Problems in Interviews

1. Listen for details. *Assume all information is relevant.*
2. Propose an example input, or ask for one from the interviewer.
3. Solve the problem the naive way.
4. Before coding, optimize the algorithm. Consider optimization methods listed below.
5. Walk through the approach in detail. *Writing code less reduces errors and saves time.*
6. Write your code.
7. Test it! Consult testing strategies below.

### Testing Methods

* Perform a conceptual test
* Pay extra attention to unusual code and hot spots (null nodes, arithmetic, etc.)
* Use small test cases. Big examples just waste time,
* Consider edge cases

### Optimization Methods

* Search for **BUD**
  * **Bottlenecks**: slow one-time work? Repeated work?
  * **Unnecessary work**
  * **Don't repeat yourself**
* DIY
  * Solve it without code
  * Reverse-engineer the strategy you used to solve the problem and code it
* Simplify & generalize
* Start with a simplified version an adapt to a complex version
* Consider time and space tradeoffs with data structures
* Solve it the wrong way and figure out the failure point.
