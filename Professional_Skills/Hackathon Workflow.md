# Maximizing the Odds of Success

1. Leverage each other's strengths: domain expertise, technical skills, passion, camaraderie, etc.
2. Figure out a real problem to solve and how you will solve it in the timeframe.
3. Write out a design statement to focus the team.
  **Design Statement**- A narrow definition of the problem defining the following:
   1. What problem are we solving?
   2. Who is the user that is suffering real pain from the problem?
   3. What will the situation look like for the user when the userâ€™s problem is addressed?
   Useful for limiting/prioritizing scope of the app
   Template: How might we improve **_(problem in the domain)_** for **_(user)_** , so that **_(user-focused outcome)_**?
4. Prototype!
   * Start with the UI/UX
   * Outline the required features to make this a reality
   * Prioritize features with your design statement
5. Check in regularly with the team for progress updates.
