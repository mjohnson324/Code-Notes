# Problem Solving

Tips for completing new projects.

1. Be as clear and detailed as possible about the problem you are trying
   to solve.
  - Take notes about the problem when it is first discussed
2. Identify an **MVP** for your project. What features does it require?
3. Prioritize key features, focusing on what matters most.
4. Set a timeline for the project, developing each feature in turn.
  - Consider what can go wrong: what must you learn, what will each
    feature require, etc.
5. Write **pseudocode** for each feature.
  - Divide and conquer! Be as detailed as possible.
  - Consider starting more abstract and drilling down to functions each component will require.
  - Also consider edge cases when writing out pseudocode.
6. When writing code, test often to avoid bugs
