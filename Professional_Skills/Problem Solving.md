# Problem Solving

## Tips for Completing New Projects

1. Be as clear and detailed as possible about the problem you are trying
   to solve.
  - Take notes about the problem when it is first discussed
2. Identify an **MVP** for your project. What features does it require?
3. Prioritize key features, focusing on what matters most.
4. Set a timeline for the project, developing each feature in turn.
  - Consider what can go wrong: what must you learn, what will each
    feature require, etc.
5. Write **pseudocode** for each feature.
  - Divide and conquer! Be as detailed as possible.
  - Consider starting more abstract and drilling down to functions each component will require.
  - Also consider edge cases when writing out pseudocode.
6. When writing code, test often to avoid bugs

## Rubber Duck Debugging

Articulate the problem before you ask for help.

1. Verbalize the question. Detail the journey that led you to here.
2. State your desired outcome.
3. Describe what actually took place in your project.
4. If you are still stuck, ask for help! Share your research and sources.
