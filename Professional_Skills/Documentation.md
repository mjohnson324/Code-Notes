# Documentation

* Comments are not documentation. Comments help project maintainers understand working code and past design decisions.
* Documenting code helps end-users understand your API.

## Good Documentation Checklist

* [ ] A README providing an overview
* [ ] Code illustrating how the API works
* [ ] Contribution guidelines
* [ ] Reference materials

## Production READMEs

* [ ] Brief explanation of what the app is and does
* [ ] Link to live site
* [ ] Technology stack
* [ ] Delve deep into a couple features. Discuss both the challenges faced and your solutions.
* [ ]Code snippets to highlight your best code

### Pitfalls to avoid

* Do not list out every single feature on your app.
* No screenshots, only screen clippings.
* Present your work as professional.
* For features you have yet to implement, list them at the bottom as future directions for the project.
* Markdown rendering errors

### Versioning:

* Versioning tends to follow the X.Y.Z patter:
    * X - breaking changes
    * Y - non-breaking changes
    * Z - patches
