# Python Practice

A repo to house some of my Python practice projects as I gain more experience with the language.

## Current Breakdown

### Grokking Algorithms

Notes and code from the book of the same name on fundamental algorithms and data structures. All code samples are in Python of course; examples pulled from the book will be marked as such.

### PyPoker

A poker game built in Python. Currently the plan is to focus specifically on object-oriented design and less on the interface.

#### Possible Directions for Game

- Compete against AI designed with recursive algorithm or trained through machine learning
- Design with a user interface. Launch as an android app with Kivy?

### Exercism

Slutions for exercism exercises will also be stored here. This will allow me to track how my coding style changes over time through git.
