# Programming Notes

A repo for notes on various topics related to computer science and programming. This seemed like the most appropriate way to record notes because I can design cheat-sheets with markdown and write and run code samples on subjects I'm reviewing.

Notes span multiple subjects including concepts, algorithms, programming languages, etc. This also includes practice small practice projects such as my solutions to exercism exercises.
