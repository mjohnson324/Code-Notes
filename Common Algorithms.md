# Algorithms

Euclidean Algorithm- Divide A by B to get the remainder. Divide by the remainder repeatedly until no remainder is left
Greatest Common Denominator-

Recurrence Relation- An equation recursively defining a sequence of values

## Common Runtimes in Seconds

| Number of Steps | $n$ | $n log(n)$ | $n^2$ | $2^n$ |
|-----------------|---|------------|-----|-----|
| 20 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 50 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 13 Days |
| 100 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 $10^{13}$ years |
| $10^6$ | 1 | 1 | 17 minutes | **no** |
| $10^9$ | 1 | 30 | 30 years | **no** |

## Greedy Algorithms

## Divide and Conquer

Subproblem- similar problem of a smaller size

Sorting- Permutation of a sequence in order

Selection Sort- Find the minimum value, swap with the first element and repeat with the remaining elements
Binary Search-
