# You have an image represented by a 2-D array of 1s and 0s. The 0s represent a box.
# Find the coordinates of the box
# There is only one box.
# The box and array are rectangular and can vary in size.
# sample input: [
#     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
#     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
#     [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
#     [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
#     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
# ]
# sample output: { "start": (2, 3), "end": (4, 5) }
