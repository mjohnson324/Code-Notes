Debug Design!

Start with a working site, then pick apart pieces, referencing other designs and their content.

Collect as many designs that you like as you can

Save them!



Start with content

Instead of focusing on aesthetics, ask how you can solve a problem with good design



The most common mistake in design is spacing

Max 2-3 lines centered text



Design 101:

    (UI) Affordance- the possibility of an action on an object

    Perceived Affordance- What the user thinks is an affordance

    Signifier- Signals that an object has affordances

    Examples: explicit, patterns, metaphorical, negative (what the user can't do), etc.

    Lying Signifier- A false perceived affordance (bad; user thinks they can take an action they can't)

    UI- How an interaction takes place

    UX- HOw the interaction feels



The act of writing the spec — describing how the program works in minute detail — will force you to actually design the program.

Micromoment- when a customer uses tech to accomplish a task



How to Spec a Project:

-Functional specs describe features from the user’s viewpoint

-Technical specs describe implementation and are secondary to functional specs

-Scenarios (think of who will use your product)

-Specify what you won’t do

-Overview (table of contents)

-Details (by the feature, screen, etc.)

    -Be granular. Specify what happens as the situation evolves (like entering a wrong password)

        -A branching narrative which converge on the same ending?

        -This gets to what code must be written

Scheduling: must be broken down to hours (what you will actually code) or you can’t estimate

    -Then compare actual times to your guesses (graph: actual hours y vs estimated hours x)

    -Time spent debugging old features counts towards that feature time

    -Prioritize features based on importance and implementation time

Voice Based Systems: Treat action development like an improv comedy script. Don't just write your script, speak it!
