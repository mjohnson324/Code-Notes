General Terms:
Macro- A rule or pattern defining how an input sequence should be mapped to an output sequence
Metaprogramming- When programs treat other programs as data. Enables self-modification, creation and analysis at runtime.
Reflectivity- A program's ability to manipulate its structure and behavior as data
DSL- Domain-Specific Language. A language with a specific/limited purpose (e.g. SQL, HTML, etc.)
ABI- Application Bytecode Interface
Null Pointer- A pointer that does not point to any object or function
Static Typing- When variables are assigned an unchanging data type before execution
Dynamic Typing- When data types are enforced at the point of execution
Middleware- Software which intercepts a process to redirect or generate a side effect
Foreign Function Interface- How a program in one languag calls routines/uses services in another
Wrapper Library- Code to provide interface for libraries/languages (ORM, Numpy?, Cython, etc.)
Orthogonal- Code without side effects
Type Coercion- When one data type is converted to another.

Higher Order Functions- Functions that return functions
Closure- a function which retains the context in which it was defined. Different results can be produced in a closure by changing the order of composition
Currying- When a function with multiple arguments is broken down into multiple functions with singular arguments.
Composition- Calling a function in a function
Function Signature- a function's inputs and outputs

Pass by Reference- Creating new pointers to variables to prevent mutations
Lazy Evaluation- Delaying the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed, and which avoids repeat evaluations.
Eager Evaluation- When an expression is evaluated as soon as it is bound to a variable
Linter- A tool that analyzes source code for errors.

Data Exhaust- Data collected "accidentally;" an underhanded tactic to get sensitive data (e.g. buying a weather database because it has location data)

Segmentation Fault (Segfault)-
Halting Problem- How do you determine if an arbitrary program and input will ever finish running? Turing proved there is no algorithm that can solve this problem for all possible scenarios.

Half-Open: a range that is exclusive (does not include the last number indicated) 
Closed: An inclusive range
