1. With your powers combined I am Captain Planet! (leverage each other's strengths: domain expertise, technical skills, passion, camaraderie, etc.)

2. Figure out a real problem to solve and how you will solve it in the timeframe.

3. Focus with a design statement!
Design Statement- A more narrow definition of the problem by making the following concrete:
	-Useful for limiting/prioritizing scope of the app
	1. What problem are we solving?
	2. Who is the user that is suffering real pain from the problem?
	3. What will the situation look like for the user when the userâ€™s problem is addressed?
	Template: How might we improve _(problem in the domain)_ for _(user)_ , so that _(user-focused outcome)_?

4. Prototype!
	1. Start with UI/UX
	2. Outline required features to make this a reality
		-Use design statement to prioritize features
