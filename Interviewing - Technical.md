	-Start with a shell (high-level)
	-Ask "next level down?"
	-Ask "do you want more details?" so you can get more granular as you go
	-Leave yourself room to spare (outline on left, details on right)
	-Go one block at a time
	-Focus on how I think vs getting a solution
	-Stay aware of time
	-Have confidence in yourself

Four Different Things to Focus on When Whiteboarding:
	1. Requirements
Ask yourself what are the requirements of this problem â€” what are the parameters, what is the input, and what is the desired output? Are there specific test cases you should take into consideration? Are there edge cases you should keep in mind while designing your solution? Once you have a good handle on the requirements, check in with the evaluator ask them to confirm your requirements.
	2. Logic
Before you start coding, consider the logic behind the problem. If the problem is complex, you should break it down into smaller, less complex problems. Once you have broken things down, take note of the steps or pseudo-code the problem. This shows the interviewer your problem solving process, and also, gives them a chance to sign off on your solution. This technique will help prevent errors you may make while coding out the problem.
	3. Syntax
Syntax comes into play once you start coding. After confirming the requirements and completing the logic, begin coding. You should be able to follow the plan you created in the previous logic step. If you are confused or concerned about your syntax, circle it so that you can come back to it and redefine your logic if necessary. 
	4. Testing
After completing your code, you should test your solution. If they gave you specific test cases, run them through your code to figure out the output. Does the output of your solution match the desired output for that test case? If not, you need to pinpoint where the problem is occurring and fix the issue, by addressing the logic or syntax. Can you identify any cases that would break your solution? If so, talk through those cases and possible solutions to the problems the cases pose with your interviewer.

Technical Question Types: Listed from more theoretical to more practice-based
	1. Algorithm (code)
	2. Design (how you think about problems and application structure)
	3. Pairing
	-Do not worry about saying something wrong; concentrate on producing the right result

Steps to Solving Problems in Interviews:
	1. Listen (for details. Assume all information is relevant)
	2. Example (debugging: too small? Special case? Examples often 50% too small)
	3. Brute force (solve it; a crappy solution is better than no solution)
	4. Optimize:
		-BUD
		-Unused info?
		-Reverse engineer a solution
		-Solve it wrong; figure out why it fails
		-Time vs Space tradeoffs
	5. Walk through the approach in detail (writing code less reduces errors and saves time)
	6. Write code (use structures where appropriate)
	7. Test:
		-Conceptual test
		-Unusual code
		-Hot spots (null nodes, arithmetic, etc.)
		-Small test cases
		-Special/edge cases
		-Don't use a big example 1st. Small ones usually work just as well.

Optimization Methods:
	1. BUD
		Bottlenecks: slow one-time work? Repeated work?
		Unnecessary work: self-explanatory
		D: Don't repeat yourself
	2. DIY
		-Solve it without code
		-Identify strategy you used to solve the problem and code that out
	3. Simplify & generalize
		-solve a simplified version
		-adapt to complex version
		-associate with similar problems!
